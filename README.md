# ArQual
ArQual, air quality index measurements in Portuguese territory.

All data is scraped from the website of [APA - Associação Portuguesa do Ambiente](https://qualar.apambiente.pt/).
That site is extremely slow and this script is meant to help with that, bringing air quality measurements right into your command line.
